"# Telangana-Weather-Report-" The Telangana Weather Report project provides an analysis of weather patterns across the region, offering insights based on collected data. It includes a Power BI report (Powerbi weather project1.pdf) that visualizes key trends such as temperature variations, rainfall distribution, and seasonal changes. Additionally, the data folder (Weather Data/) contains raw or processed weather-related information used for analysis. A README file (README.md) serves as documentation, but it should be updated with details such as the projectâ€™s purpose, data sources, and how to interpret the results. This project helps in understanding Telangana's climate trends, which can be useful for weather forecasting, agriculture, and environmental planning. To upload this project to GitHub, all files should be added to a repository, committed, and pushed using Git, ensuring that documentation is clear for others to explore and use.
